Example Applications
====================

We've made three QuickFIX/N example applications:

1. The [Trade Client][0] is a command line client that sends orders.
2. The [Executor][1] takes orders over a FIX session and executes them.
3. The [UI Demo][2] is a graphical Windows application where users can
   send FIX messages.

The Trade Client and Executor can be configured to send and execute
orders with each other.

Have your own app you'd like to share?  [Contact us!][3]
