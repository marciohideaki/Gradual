Comparisons to QuickFIX
-----------------------
QuickFIX/n is a .NET port of [QuickFIX][0], an open source C++ FIX engine.

We love QuickFIX.  We have been contributors nearly since its
conception and use it heavily in our products and consulting.

The goal of QuickFIX/n is to create an open source FIX engine that feels
native to C#.  The (C++) QuickFIX project maintains a C# wrapper 
which has been used successfully in .NET for many years, but it results
in code that is not idiomatic of .NET development.  QuickFIX/n
attempts to keep the same robustness and conformance of QuickFIX
with a similar API while bringing native performance and idiomatic 
usage to .NET.

For Java development, please visit the excellent [QuickFIX/J][1].

QuickFIX/n uses the QuickFIX name with the full backing and support of QuickFIX 
and its creator Oren Miller.

Commercial Backing

Work on QuickFIX/n is sponsored by Connamara Systems.
